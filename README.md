Created a single page website of my hometown, Grand Rapids, MI. All rights reserved to the state of Michigan!


**Fixed site for mobile devices

Need to fix it for tablets, also need to understand hitting breakpoints for all devices has to be border line impossible, or not needed!
I've already learned that hitting popular widths is something not to aim for in every project, and that breakpoints should adapt to content needs.

I need to find some cooler fonts to use, since I have barely touched fonts at all in my projects!!! Will update with better fonts.

Next time I build a website I think I need to learn to build for mobile first then hit desktop last. Might be easier doing that
then desktop to mobile, but I am still learning.

Also I need to get some hosting for my projects.
