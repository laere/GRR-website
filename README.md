# GRR-website
Created a single page website of my hometown, Grand Rapids, MI. All rights reserved to the state of Michigan!


**Fixed site for mobile devices, fuck tablets. Not sure how to hit all devices.

I need to find some cooler fonts to use, since I have barely touched fonts at all in my projects!!! Will update with better fonts.

Next time I build a website I think I need to learn to build for mobile first then hit desktop last. Might be easier doing that
then desktop to mobile, but I am still learning.

Also I need to get some hosting for my projects.
